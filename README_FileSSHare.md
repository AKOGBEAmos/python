* Transferring files between devices can seem really critical sometimes, specially for big and sensitive files. Moreover, transferring files using a USB Key drive can be sometimes critical due to the risk of virus infection but also, for the low speed of transfer/copy on drive like 2.0 drives. This is why it appears necessary to find a secure solution that can be used efficiently and transfer or send files in Client-to-client or Server-to-client architecture at a fast speed and ensuring Confidentiality.

# FileSShare

Is a secure file transfer application with end-to-end encryption. Ensure the confidentiality and integrity of transferred files, and implement access controls and audit logs.

## Goals

The goals are to build a secure file transfer application and also to ensure the fast speed download or transfer rate and the security of all the operations that will be made.  Specifically, we would:

- Provide a secure transfer application app with a smooth and user-friendly GUI interface 
- Ensure fast connectivity and transfer of the files
- Test the application to see if all the features are implemented and the limits of the app.
